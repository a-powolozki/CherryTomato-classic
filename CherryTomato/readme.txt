CherryTomato is a productivity tool that helps you focus and avoid procrastination. It relies on the Pomodoro Technique of concentrating for 25 minutes at a time.
Though this doesn't sound like a big deal, it has been very helpful for me personally and the technique is gaining popularity rapidly around the world.

Requirements:
Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, 7 or higher
Microsoft .NET framework v3.5 (download from here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&displaylang=en)

Command line:
/t - opens the trace form that will show you diagnostics.
/c:settingsfile - uses an alternative settings file than the default %appdata%\cherrytomato\settings.xml


Note:
CherryTomato monitors active application and mouse/keyboard activity. Hence, security programs might perceive this as a threat (like a keylogger etc.). This information
is not stored anywhere and is not sent anywhere - it is only visible to you when evaluating your pomodoro.
CherryTomato keeps a Sqlite database of your pomodoros with the ratings. This will allow you to analyse your productivity over time. For now, the only way to analyze
this data is the simple dashboard or by manually querying the database.
